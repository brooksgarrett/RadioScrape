# RadioScrape

A super simple Ruby script to call the "Now Playing" service for a certain station and find out what is playing.

# Getting Started

First you need to create and app at [https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications). Set the callback to http://brooksgarrett.com/projects/radioscrap/callback.html. I don't log your tokens (it's pure HTML and javascript.)

Give the program your client ID and client secret to get your token link. Once you follow the link paste the code into the app and set debug to false.

You're ready to go!
